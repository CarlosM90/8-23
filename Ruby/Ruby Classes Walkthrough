Remember our zoo? 

Let's fill it up.

Declare an overarching class: 
Class Animal

  def breathe
    puts "I am breathing"
  end

end


Declare a child class: 
Class Lion < Animal
  
  def roar
    puts "ROAR!"
  end

end

Create some instances of Animal and Lion with ".new"
Add more methods, more child classes, etc.

Initialize method: Special method that will load up certain attributes for the class instance
Animal:
def initialize(name)
  @name = name
end 

Lion
def initialize(name, feet)
  super(name)
  @feet = 4
end
